**Core Protocol contracts**

![Github Actions](https://github.com/devanonon/hardhat-foundry-template/workflows/test/badge.svg)

### Getting Started

 * Use Foundry: 
```bash
forge install
```

 * Use Hardhat:
```bash
npm install
```

### Features

 * Write / run tests with either Hardhat or Foundry:
```bash
forge test
# or
npx hardhat test
```

 * Use Hardhat's task framework
```bash
npx hardhat example
```

### Notes

Whenever you install new libraries using Foundry, make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`. This is required because we use `hardhat-preprocessor` and the `remappings.txt` file to allow Hardhat to resolve libraries you install with Foundry.
